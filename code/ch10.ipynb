    "## 10.1  Signals and systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of signal processing, a system is an abstract representation of anything that takes a signal as input and produces a signal as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an electronic amplifier is a circuit that takes an electrical signal as input and produces a (louder) signal as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, when you listen to a musical performance, you can think of the room as a system that takes the sound of the performance at the location where it is generated and produces a somewhat different sound at the location where you hear it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `linear, time-invariant system`  is a system with these two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - If you put two inputs into the system at the same time, the result is the sum of their outputs. \n",
    "    - Mathematically, if an input $x_1$ produces output $y_1$ and another input $x_2$ produces $y_2$, then $a x_1 + b x_2$ produces $a y_1 + b y_2$, where $a$ and $b$ are scalars.\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Time invariance: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - The effect of the system doesn’t vary over time, or depend on the state of the system. \n",
    "    - So if inputs $x_1[n]$ and $x_2[n]=x_1[n-m]$ differ by a shift (=$m$) in time, their outputs $y_1[n]$ and $y_2[n]=y_1[n-m]$ differ by the same shift (=$m$), but are otherwise identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many physical systems have these properties, at least approximately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Circuits that contain only resistors, capacitors and inductors are LTI, to the degree that the components behave like their idealized models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mechanical systems that contain springs, masses and dashpots are also LTI, assuming linear springs (force proportional to displacement) and dashpots (force proportional to velocity).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also, and most relevant to applications in this book, the media that transmit sound (including air, water and solids) are well-modeled by LTI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "LTI systems are described by `linear differential (difference) equations`, and the solutions of those equations are complex sinusoids \n",
    "\n",
    "- [Differential Equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_differential_equation).\n",

    "\n",
    "This result provides an algorithm for computing the effect of an LTI system on an input signal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Express the signal as the sum of `complex sinusoid` components.\n",
    "1. For each input component, compute the corresponding output component.\n",
    "1. Add up the output components.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, I hope this algorithm sounds familiar. It’s the same algorithm we used for convolution in Section 8.6, and for differentiation in Section 9.3. This process is called spectral decomposition because we “decompose” the input signal into its spectral components."

    "In order to apply this process to an LTI system, we have to characterize the system by finding its effect on each component of the input signal. For mechanical systems, it turns out that there is a simple and efficient way to do that: you kick it and record the output.\n",

    "Technically, the “kick” is called an impulse and the output is called the impulse response. You might wonder how a single impulse can completely characterize a system. You can see the answer by computing the DFT of an impulse. Here’s a wave array with an impulse at t=0:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "The filter that corresponds to a `moving-average  window` is a `low-pass filter` with the approximate shape of a Gaussian curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that we did not know the window or the corresponding filter, and we wanted to characterize this system. We would do that by inputting an impulse and measuring the `impulse response`.\n",

That is, like a firing range.\n",

The violin recording I started with has already been transformed by one system: the room where it was recorded.

To properly simulate the sound of a violin in a different room, I should have characterized the room where the violin was recorded and applied the inverse of that transfer function first."

    "\n",
    "- An impulse is made up of components with amplitude 1 at all frequencies.\n",
    "- The impulse response contains the sum of the responses of the system to all of these components.\n",
    "- The transfer function, which is the DFT of the impulse response, encodes the effect of the system on each frequency component in the form of an amplitude multiplier and a phase shift.\n",

    "\n",
    "But if you don’t like that, there’s another way to think about it altogether: convolution! By the Convolution Theorem, multiplication in the frequency domain corresponds to convolution in the time domain. In this example, the output of the system is the convolution of the input and the system response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the keys to understanding why that works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can think of the samples in the input wave as a sequence of impulses with varying amplitude.\n",
    "- Each impulse in the input yields a copy of the impulse response, shifted in time (because the system is time-invariant) and scaled by the amplitude of the input.\n",
    "- The output is the sum of the shifted, scaled copies of the impulse response. The copies add up because the system is linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s work our way up gradually: suppose that instead of firing one gun, we fire two: a big one with amplitude 1 at t=0 and a smaller one with amplitude 0.5 at t=1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute the response of the system by adding up the original impulse response and a scaled, shifted copy of itself. Here’s a function that makes a shifted, scaled copy of a wave:\n",

    "    res.scale(factor)\n",
    "    return res\n",

    "The parameter shift is a time shift in seconds; factor is a multiplicative factor.\n",

    "```python \n",
    "    shift = 1\n",
    "    factor = 0.5\n",
    "    gun2 = response + shifted_scaled(response, shift, factor)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 10.4 shows the result. You can hear what it sounds like in chap10.ipynb. Not surprisingly, it sounds like two gunshots, the first one louder than the second.\n",
    "\n",

    "    dt = 1 / 441\n",
    "    total = 0\n",

    "```python \n",

    "- The input is a sequence of impulses, so the output is the sum of scaled, shifted copies of the impulse response; that sum is the convolution of the input and the impulse response.\n",

The DFT of the input encodes the magnitude and phase offset of the frequency components it contains. Multiplying the DFT of the input by the transfer function yields the DFT of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equivalence of these descriptions should not be a surprise; it is basically a statement of the Convolution Theorem: convolution of f and g in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain. And if you wondered why convolution is defined as it is, which seemed backwards when we talked about smoothing and difference windows, now you know the reason: the definition of convolution appears naturally in the response of an LTI system to a signal."

    "In Section 10.4 I describe convolution as the sum of shifted, scaled copies of a signal. Strictly speaking, this operation is linear convolution, which does not assume that the signal is periodic.\n",
    "But in Section 10.3, when we multiply the DFT of the signal by the transfer function, that operation corresponds to circular convolution, which assumes that the signal is periodic. As a result, you might notice that the output contains an extra note at the beginning, which wraps around from the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there is a standard solution to this problem. If you add enough zeros to the end of the signal before computing the DFT, you can avoid wrap-around and compute a linear convolution.\n",

    "The Open AIR library provides a “centralized... on-line resource for anyone interested in auralization and acoustical impulse response data” (http://www.openairlib.net). Browse their collection of impulse response data and download one that sounds interesting. Find a short recording that has the same sample rate as the impulse response you downloaded.\n",
    "Simulate the sound of your recording in the space where the impulse response was measured, computed two way: by convolving the recording with the impulse response and by computing the filter that corresponds to the impulse response and multiplying by the DFT of the recording.\n",
