    "Figure 11.2 shows what’s happening in the frequency domain. The top row is the spectrum of the original signal. The next row is the spectrum of the modulated signal, after multiplying by the carrier. It contains two copies of the original spectrum, shifted by plus and minus 10 kHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why, recall that convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain. Conversely, multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain. When we multiply the signal by the carrier, we are convolving its spectrum with the DFT of the carrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the carrier is a simple cosine wave, its DFT is two impulses, at plus and minus 10 kHz. Convolution with these impulses makes shifted, scaled copies of the spectrum. Notice that the amplitude of the spectrum is smaller after modulation. The energy from the original signal is split between the copies.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you listen to the demodulated signal, it sounds pretty good. The extra copies of the spectrum add high frequency components that were not it the original signal, but they are so high that your speakers probably can’t play them, and most people can’t hear them. But if you have good speakers and good ears, you might.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, you can get rid of the extra components by applying a low-pass filter:\n",

    "demodulated_spectrum.low_pass(10000)\n",

    "The result is quite close to the original wave, although about half of the power is lost after demodulating and filtering. But that’s not a problem in practice, because much more of the power is lost in transmitting and receiving the broadcast signal. We have to `amplify` (放大, 增強) the result anyway, another factor of 2 is not an issue."

    "I explained amplitude modulation in part because it is interesting, but mostly because it will help us understand sampling. “Sampling” is the process of measuring an analog signal at an series of points in time, usually with equal spacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the WAV files we have used as examples were recorded by sampling the output of a microphone using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The sampling rate for most of them is 44.1 kHz, which is the standard rate for “CD quality” sound, or 48 kHz, which is the standard for DVD sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "At 48 kHz, the folding frequency is 24 kHz, which is higher than most people can hear (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range).\n",
    "\n",
    "In most of these waves, each sample has 16 bits, so there are $2^{16} = 65536$ distinct levels. This `bit depth` turns out to be enough that adding more bits does not improve the sound quality noticeably (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, applications other than audio signals might require higher sampling rates, in order to capture higher frequencies, or higher bit-depth, in order to reproduce waveforms with more fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the effect of the sampling process, I am going to start with a wave sampled at 44.100 kHz and select samples from it at about 11.025 kHz. This is not exactly the same as sampling from an analog signal, but the effect is the same.\n",

    "impulses = make_impulses(wave, 4)\n",
    "sampled = wave * impulses\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is the same; it still doesn’t sound very good, but now we understand why. Multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain.
