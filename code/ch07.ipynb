    "In this chapter I presented the DFT in the form of matrix multiplication. We compute the synthesis matrix, $M$, and the analysis matrix, $M^{*}$. When we multiply $M^{*}$ by the wave array, $y$, each element of the result is the product of a row from $M^{*}$ and y, which we can write in the form of a summation:\n",

    "\n",
    "Normally we evaluate this summation for N values of k, running from 0 to N−1. We could evaluate it for other values of k, but there is no point, because they start to repeat. That is, the value at $k$ is the same as the value at $k+N$ or $k+2N$ or $k−N$, etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As an aside, writing the DFT in the form of a summation provides an insight into how it works. If you review the diagram in Section 6.2, you’ll see that each column of the synthesis matrix is a signal evaluated at a sequence of times. The analysis matrix is the (conjugate) transpose of the synthesis matrix, so each row is a signal evaluated at a sequence of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, each summation is the correlation of y with one of the signals in the array (see Section 5.5). That is, each element of the DFT is a correlation that quantifies the similarity of the wave array, y, and a complex exponential at a particular frequency."

    "The `class Spectrum` in thinkdsp is based on `np.ftt.rfft`, which computes the “real DFT”; that is, it works with real signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the DFT as presented in this chapter is more general than that; it works with complex signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what happens when we apply the “full DFT” to a real signal? Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    fs = np.arange(N)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s tempting to think that these values are the right frequencies. The problem is that dft doesn’t know the sampling rate. The DFT assumes that the duration of the wave is 1 time unit, so it thinks the sampling rate is N per time unit. In order to interpret the frequencies, we have to convert from these arbitrary time units back to seconds, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    plt.plot(fs, amps)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 7.3 shows the amplitude of the signal for each frequency component from 0 to 10 kHz. The left half of the figure is what we should expect: the dominant frequency is at 500 Hz, with harmonics dropping off like 1/f.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the right half of the figure is a surprise. Past 5000 Hz, the amplitude of the harmonics start growing again, peaking at 9500 Hz. What’s going on?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer: aliasing. Remember that with framerate 10000 Hz, the folding frequency is 5000 Hz. As we saw in Section 2.3, a component at 5500 Hz is indistinguishable from a component at 4500 Hz. When we evaluate the DFT at 5500 Hz, we get the same value as at 4500 Hz. Similarly, the value at 6000 Hz is the same as the one at 4000 Hz, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DFT of a real signal is symmetric around the folding frequency. Since there is no additional information past this point, we can save time by evaluating only the first half of the DFT, and that’s exactly what np.fft.rfft does."
